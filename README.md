# Udacity Data Analyst Specialty Final Project

This analysis will examine data on the number of firearm background checks in the United States, categorized by date, state and weapon type, as correlated with census data collected by the United State Census Bureau.

These data, presented in the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and by the The U.S. Census Bureau Census Data will be used in an attempt to draw conclusions and answer questions related to population size and number of background checks.

It's important to note that these data are simply for background checks run per state. Variations in state law and reporting compliance make these figures difficult to verify or relate to gun sales. A one to one relation between a background check and a gun purchase cannot be made, however, a study conducted by Jurgen Brauer of Georgia Regents University utilized a method where each long gun and handgun check was counted as 1.1 sales. Each multiple-gun check was counted as two sales. This is to account for gun purchases between individuals where a background check was not done. This study is available here.
